Welcome to my (freeCodeCamp)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/review-js-fundamentals-by-building-a-gradebook-app/] Gradebook mini project for JavaScript review/practice. I passed Step 1 by researching, then cutting and pasting a solution. While it's a valid method, I want to undertand why it worked. I tried to find lessons on improving logical thinking, but it seems the advice is mostly to just try and solve a lot of problems. Here I will document my progress through the challenge.
